# METS Reader & Writer

By [Artefactual](https://www.artefactual.com/)

METSRW is a library to help with parsing and creating METS files.
It provides an API, and abstracts away the actual creation of the XML.
METSRW was initially created for use in [Archivematica](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/) and is managed as part of that project.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute metsrw with attribution under the terms of the AGPL license.
